# SmartCity-Garbage-collection
Final Project: 
    Waste Collection Routing Optimization for Smart Cities

In this project you will develop a waste collection routing optimisation system for a simulated smart city environment using graphs.

Waste management is a growing problem in urban areas globally, especially in developing countries where the manual, disorganized waste collection systems are unable to scale with population growth and increasing landfill. The burden on municipal waste management authorities has rapidly increased with the spread of urban areas and overall increase in waste. Waste collection systems often fail to keep up and are unable to collect waste timely, resulting in overflowing garbage bins. This in turn leads to improperly disposed garbage, which results in health hazards like air pollution and spread of diseases via parasites and contaminated water. This cycle of disease and pollution can be stopped if waste is collected well in time with a cost-efficient smart solution.
